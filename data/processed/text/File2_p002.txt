Provided that if any such day is not a Currency Business Day, it shall be postponed to the following Currency Business Day.

Provided that in the event of a postponement of any Valuation Date (k) which causes a Valuation Date (k) to fall less than two

(k) shall be postponed such that it falls on the second Currency Business Day following such Valuation Date (k).

RR(k) x ENA

Where

RR(k) means the Rate of Return on the relevant Early Cash Settlement Date (k)
RR(1) =                              2.6500%

RR(2) =                              5.3000%

RR(3) =                              7.9500%

RR(4) =                              10.6000%

RR(5) =                              13.2500%

7.950% x ENA

Means in respect of Underlying (i) and Valuation Date (k), the performance of such Underlying (i) on such Valuation Date (k)
calculated as follows :

U(ik) / ILG)
Means in respect of Underlying (i) and any Valuation Date (k), the Index Level of such Underlying (i) at the Valuation Time
on the Valuation Date (k).

Means in respect of Underlying (i) and any Daily Valuation Date (t) , the Index Level of such Underlying (i) at the Glider
Valuation Time, on the Daily Valuation Date(t).

On each Valuation Date (k), the relevant Lowest Performance (k) will be calculated as follows:
Min [ Performance(',), Performance(’,), Performance(*,) ]

On Valuation Date (6), Provided that no Early Equity Amount Opportunity has occured,
If on Valuation Date (6) the Underlying (i) with the Lowest Performance (6) is equal to or greater than its Barrier Level (6)

Party A shall pay Party B                                                    15.9000%           x ENA
Otherwise,

Party B shall pay Party A                                                   ENA x [1-Lowest Performance (6)]
The time at which the Index Level of the Underlying (i) is published or announced by the Exchange.

In respect of Underlying (i), the Scheduled Closing Time on the relevant Exchange on the relevant Daily Valuation Date (t). If
the relevant Exchange closes prior to its Scheduled Closing Time, the Glider Valuation Time shall be such actual closing time

Valuation Date (1)                          16-Mar-20
Valuation Date (2)                           15-Sep-20
Valuation Date (3)                          16-Mar-21
Valuation Date (4)                           14-Sep-21
Valuation Date (5)                          15-Mar-22
Valuation Date (6)                           14-Sep-22

If a Valuation Date (k) is a Disrupted Day with respect to any Underlying (i), then the Valuation Date (k) for all Underlyings
shall be the first succeeding Exchange Business Day that is not a Disrupted Day with respect to any Underlying (i), unless
each of the eight Exchange Business Days immediately following the Scheduled Valuation Date (k) is a Disrupted Day with
respect to any Underlying (i). In that case (i) that eighth Exchange Business Day shall be deemed to be the Valuation Date (k)
for all Underlyings, notwithstanding the fact that such day is a Disrupted Day with respect to any Underlying (i), and (ii) with
respect to the relevant Underlying affected by the occurrence of a Disrupted Day on that eighth Exchange Business Day, the
Calculation Agent shall determine the level of that Underlying (i) as of the relevant Valuation Time on that eighth Exchange
Business Day.
