For the avoidance of doubt, each Valuation Date shall be a Scheduled Trading
Day for the Exchange. If it is not such a day then Valuation Date is postponed to
the next such day, and where a Valuation Date is postponed due to the
occurrence of a Disrupted Day, the Valuation Date for each Asset shall be
postponed together.

Where a Valuation Date is postponed due to the occurrence of a Disrupted Day,
the provisions of Section 6.6 of the Equity Definitions will apply, provided that the
passage in Section 6.6(c) “, the Valuation Date for each Share not affected by
the occurrence of a Disrupted Day shall be the Scheduled Trading Day, and the
Valuation Date for each Share affected by the occurrence of a Disrupted Day”
shall be deleted and replaced with “, for all Shares in the Reference Basket,
regardless of whether or not they are affected by the occurrence of the Disrupted
Day, the Valuation Date” and that the phrase “relating to that Share” in the fourth
and fifth lines of Section 6.6(c) are deleted.
