Trading Disruption:

Exchange Disruption

Early Closure:

Disrupted Day:

Either:
(i)(a) the occurrence or existence, in respect of any Component Security, of:

(1) a Trading Disruption, which the Calculation Agent determines is material, at any time during the one hour period that ends
at the relevant Valuation Time in respect of the Exchange on which such Component Security is principally traded;

(2) an Exchange Disruption, which the Calculation Agent determines is material, at any time during the one hour period that
ends at the relevant Valuation Time in respect of the Exchange on which such Component Security is principally traded; OR

(3) an Early Closure; AND

(b) the aggregate of all Component Securities in respect of which a Trading Disruption, an Exchange Disruption or an Early
Closure occurs or exists comprises 20 per cent. or more of the level of the Index; OR

(ii) the occurrence or existence, in respect of futures or options contracts relating to the Index, of: (a) a Trading Disruption;
(b) an Exchange Disruption, which in either case the Calculation Agent determines is material, at any time during the one
hour period that ends at the Valuation Time in respect of the Related Exchange; or (c) an Early Closure.

For the purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event exists in respect of the Index at any time, if a Market
Disruption Event occurs in respect of a Component Security at that time, then the relevant percentage contribution of that
Component Security to the level of the Index shall be based on a comparison of (x) the portion of the level of the Index
attributable to that Component Security to (y) the overall level of the Index, in each case using the official opening weightings
as published by the Index Sponsor as part of the market "opening data".

Any suspension of or limitation imposed on trading by the relevant Exchange or Related Exchange or otherwise and whether
by reason of movements in price exceeding limits permitted by the relevant Exchange or Related Exchange or otherwise: (i)
relating to any Component Security on the Exchange in respect of such Component Security; or (ii) in futures or options
contracts relating to the Index on the Related Exchange.

Any event (other than an Early Closure) that disrupts or impairs (as determined by the Calculation Agent) the ability of
market participants in general to effect transactions in, or obtain market values for: (i) any Component Security on the
Exchange in respect of such Component Security; or (ii) futures or options contracts relating to the Index on the Related
Exchange.

The closure on any Exchange Business Day of the Exchange in respect of any Component Security or the Related Exchange
prior to its Scheduled Closing Time unless such earlier closing is announced by such Exchange or Related Exchange (as the
case may be) at least one hour prior to the earlier of: (i) the actual closing time for the regular trading session on such
Exchange or Related Exchange (as the case may be) on such Exchange Business Day; and (ii) the submission deadline for
orders to be entered into the Exchange or Related Exchange system for execution at the relevant Valuation Time on such
Exchange Business Day.

Any Scheduled Trading Day on which: (i) the Index Sponsor fails to publish the level of the Index; (ii) the Related Exchange
fails to open for trading during its regular trading session; or (iii) a Market Disruption Event has occurred.
